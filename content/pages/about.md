I started my journey in software development in 2012, where I started my bachelor's degree in IT at University of Western Sydney while working a part time data entry job. Transferred to the University of Technology, Sydney and eventually gratuated in 2019 with distinction in a bachelor of science in information technology. First working as a WordPress developer, learning to create and modify themes and moving on to maintaining and updating existing websites for clients. Afterwards, took a deep dive into Node.js and single page application development with React.js.

First language I learned was C++, and eventually moving on to JavaScript and a little bit of TypeScript. In addition to the programming languages that were part of my courses I've been [learning](/learn/) on my own using the vast (and mostly free) resources available on the internet. Most of my strength is in front-end development, but my primary skills are with React (web and a little bit of mobile native), Node.js, TypeScript, HTML and CSS3/SCSS.
